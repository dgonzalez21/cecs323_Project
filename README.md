# SQL
- Create.sql is the most up to date code to generate the DB
### I want to make changes to the SQL
- Download MySQLWorkbench and open the ProjectModel.wrb file. This contains the latest visual form of our database. I used this because i found it easier to write the DB visually using an ERR diagram. 

### I made changes how do I get SQL
- Click "database > Forward enginer" then click steps until you get to screen where it says copy SQL to clipboard.  This is the generated SQL which can be run. It will need to be fixed from "mydb" -> 'schooldbname123' you can change that in any notepad.

### Why does it say "mydb".'order' or 'mydb'.'thing
- Because this code was built to be run on my local mySQL db, It can be easily migrated to our school DB by using find and replace to switch 'mydb' to our school db name

# Data Generation
This could be more effiecent but it works and i already started going this direction.

## How to setup
- put index.html, script.js, faker.min.js  in a folder
- open index.html
- look at console
## How to make edits
- log results to console for data 
- look at faker.js docs (https://github.com/Marak/faker.js)
