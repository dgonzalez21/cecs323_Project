This is a school project for fall 2018. This file project is copyrighted by its creators. This repository is for the purpose of sharing work with other project memebers.


#SQL
- Create.sql is the most up to date code to generate the DB
### Why does it say "mydb".'order' or 'mydb'.'thing
- Because this code was built to be run on my local mySQL db, It can be easily migrated to our school DB by using find and replace to switch 'mydb' to our school db name

#Data Generation
This could be more effiecent but it works and i already started going this direction.

##How to setup
- put index.html, script.js, faker.min.js  in a folder
- open index.html
- look at console
##How to make edits
- log results to console for data 
- look at faker.js docs (https://github.com/Marak/faker.js) 


#TODO
##-start making the queries
##- Check my WORK PLZ
